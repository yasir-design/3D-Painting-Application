# 3D Painting Application in Unity

## Sprint 1
#### Description
Create a painting tool by creating 3D primitives where the user clicks on the screen, and destroy the primitives after 3 seconds. Create a user interface that allows the user to control the randomization of the size and color of generated 3D primitives. 
#### Purpose
- Basics of interaction design, flowcharts, Unity interface, and scripting.
- User input, camera, raycasting, screen-space, world space, hierarchies, game objects, prefabs and build requirements.
- Random number generation, position, scale, rotation, color theory, setting attributes, user interfaces, interface elements, promoting interfaces from inspector to UIs


## Sprint 2
#### Description
Upgrade sprint 1 painting app with the following functionality features: 
- User input and time-based paint object clearing functionality
- Paint Stroke size, glow, and opacity features modifiable via UI sliders
- Model 3D clock, connect it to system time, allow the user to change the time of day to complement the userâ€™s painting experience.
- Clock tutorial is created by catlikecoding
#### Purpose
- Use the math library, look up scripting documentation, building algorithms and use of loops and switch statements.
- Create higher quality user flows, diagrams, object representations, UI functionality and organization.
- distinguish what objects the user is clicking on, add more complexity to their prefabs and open up more options to the user through the UI.
- Usability considerations of user interfaces to make decisions for grouping, organizing, and naming schemes for ease of use for both user and developer, how to use looping structures and logical operators.

## Sprint 3
#### Description
Upgrade sprint 2 painting app with the following functionality features: 
- Create three multiple object prefabs for spawning, each with their own three animations that the user can choose from
- Update UI to allow user to select one of three objects to spawn, and one of three animations to play on those objects
- Update UI to allow user to change the speed of the animations, and allows user to randomize the type of animation and its speed
#### Purpose
- Basics of motion design and how to create animation by code and by using the animation system. Students will be able to control transitions of multiple animations on one prefab/game object by building an animator and setting the transitions between animations by code.
- Create more advanced prefabs with multiple objects, and with multiple animations. Students will understand setting up an animator to accept multiple animations, transitions between animations, and how to switch between different animation states. Students will learn how to connect UI elements to animators to allow users to change animation states.
- Make effective use of the animator and animation windows to create animations, understand how to break down complex parts of code or animation into simpler parts for creation and modification ease, and understand how to use forEach loops to process lists of unknown size.

## Sprint 4
#### Description
Upgrade sprint 3 painting app with the following functionality features: 
- Paint behind the UI
- Hide and show the UI
- Animate UI with code, and disable Hide button while UI is moving
- Organize, label, color code sections of UI elements
- All UI elements are functioning correctly
- All attributes of spawned objects relating to UI are responsive to UI elements
- Changing between the three prefabs and three animations are hot keyed
- Animation speed changes doesnt not overwrite previous anim speeds only modifies
#### Purpose
- Organize and present complicated UI interfaces, organize rendering orders for 2D and 3D graphics, animate objects with multi-threaded code, and refactor prefabs and code to fix bugs.
- Understand testing procedures to identify issues in their code, and external assets, using collection data structures to record initial parameters of objects, and standardization practices for their code and external assets.
- Understand naming, commenting, organization and refactoring processes for clean, legible code, and be able to read through and understand all code generated in this class project.
